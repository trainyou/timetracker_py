You can do one more thing while you’re at it, which is to make sure the Django secret key used for cryptographic signing isn’t hard-coded in settings.py, which Git will likely track. Remove the following line from project/settings.py:

SECRET_KEY = "django-insecure-o6w@a46mx..."  # Remove this line
Replace it with the following:

import os

# ...

try:
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]
except KeyError as e:
    raise RuntimeError("Could not find a SECRET_KEY in environment") from e
    
    
This tells Django to look in your environment for SECRET_KEY rather than including it in your application source code.

Note: For larger projects, check out django-environ to configure your Django application with environment variables.

Finally, set the key in your environment. Here’s how you could do that on Ubuntu Linux using OpenSSL to set the key to an eighty-character string:


$ echo "export SECRET_KEY='$(openssl rand -hex 40)'"> .DJANGO_SECRET_KEY
$ source .DJANGO_SECRET_KEY
You can cat the contents of .DJANGO_SECRET_KEY to see that openssl has generated a cryptographically secure hex string key:

$ cat .DJANGO_SECRET_KEY
export SECRET_KEY='26a2d2ccaf9ef850...'
Alright, you’re all set. That’s all you need to have a minimally functioning Django app.

How to move files to static folder from static files

the files in the static_root is not serving static files while done by staticfiles_dirs?

buttons should be of 'type' submit as type='submit' otherwise no action is implemented

reverse(track_page) will generate the exact url '/track_page' which calls 'track_page' function.


from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # Define URL pattern for the login view
    path('login/', views.login, name='login'),
    
    # Define URL pattern for the track page view
    path('track_page/', views.track_page, name='track_page'),
]

the above is for addressing the name conflict when using the 'reverese' function in the redirect django

------
BEST METHOD TO RUN:

firstly change the models.py by adding a method:

class Daily_Records(models.Model):
    l_date = models.DateField(auto_now_add= True)
    login_time = models.TimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    logout_time = models.TimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    assignments = models.CharField(max_length = 200, null=True)
    
    @staticmethod
    def delete_all():
        Daily_Records.objects.all().delete()
        
--------------

then externally in the database execute the command 

- UPDATE sqlite_sequence SET seq = 0 WHERE sqlite_sequence.name = "table_name";




ALTERNATE METHOD: 
- drop table <table_name>;

If there is any deletion of the table externally from database terminal;

follow the below

delete all migrations

in db, 

- delete from django_migrations where app='appname';

- python manage.py makemigrations appname

- python manage.py migrate
